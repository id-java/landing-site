            <h1 id="rname">Salsa a la Parth</h1>
            <p id="ingred">
                
1 can black beans
1 lime
1 avocado
1/4 red onion, diced
1/2 cup corn
1 tomato
1 green jalapeno, sliced and diced
1/4 tsp cumin powder
cilantro
pinch of pepper
salt to taste
                               
            </p>

                    How to make it edible:

1. Rinse and drain the black beans, and add them to a pot
2. Add diced onions, jalapenos, tomato, and corn to the pot
3. Chop your avocado into 1/8" x 1/8" cubes and add to the mix
4. Add the salt, cumin, lime, and pepper
5. Mix CAREFULLY. Make sure you're not mashing the avocado and black beans into a paste.
6. Consume more than you had promised yourself because this mix is somehow actually really good(??)


I best enjoy this with cup style chips!
